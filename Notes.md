# Notes :)

## System

- When making a project, it's good to have some kind of system in place, for example

    - Content max width is 1000px (except for background images and colors)
        - This is so that the page still looks good on very large displays

    - Main background color is X
    - Main text color is Y
    - First accent color is A
    - Second accent color is B

    - Main text font is "foo"
    - All headings use font "bar"

    - Normal font size is N
    - H1 font size is ...
    - H2 font size is ...

    - The main page starts with a 100vh section containing an H1
        - All subpages start with a 500px section containing an H1

    - All sections start with an H2
    - All pages have the same header and footer

    - I also like making a set of generic, reusable elements;
        - Standard section template
        - Standard styled button template

    - Overall it's good to have one consistent style everywhere
    - Not **everything** has to follow the system, for example "Hola, soy Dafne" on the front page is very nice as completely unique, it looks great.

## Random notes

- I really liked your JS idea of loading the header/footer, so I used that idea :)
- Test with medium sized browsers too
- Mobile phones don't have a mouse cursor; mobile phones don't show hover effects
- Too much animation can be distracting
- Always use high quality pictures
- Use pictures that are not too big or too small
- Check the page loading on a slow connection, if the background images take long to load, will the page still look good and text be still easy to read?
- Keep the contrast between text and background high
- Chromium / Google Chrome has a tool called Lighthouse, I recommend checking it out
